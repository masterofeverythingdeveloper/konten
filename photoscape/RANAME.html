1. Click the Add button from the Rename Window. This will open a desktop explorer window. <br />2. Choose the images on your system you would like to rename and press OK. <br />Note: You can also drag and drop files into the index window instead of browsing through the explorer. <br /><br />
<h2>To Rename Images</h2>
