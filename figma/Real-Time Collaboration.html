<h2>Real-Time Collaboration</h2>
<p>Figma truly is the Google docs of design tools. Once you start collaborating with fellow designers, developers, and clients in real-time on a design project, you&rsquo;ll never want to go back. You can share your design with anyone and they can watch your progress, <strong>comment</strong>, and even participate as you bring your pixels to life.</p>
