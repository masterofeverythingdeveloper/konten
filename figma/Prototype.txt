<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>Prototyping is an important process of design. Creating a prototype helps your engineers understand how the interactions and animations should work in the final product. Figma makes it super simple to create prototypes using transitions without downloading a third-party app.</p>
<p>Prototype faster with Figma. Animate transitions with ease, add micro-interactions to your flow, and use smart-animate to quickly create interactions that look great on any device.</p>
