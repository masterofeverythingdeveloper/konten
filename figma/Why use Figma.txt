<h2>Why use Figma?</h2>
<p>Only a few years ago, in 2016,&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://figma.com/">Figma</a></strong>&nbsp;came out as the first design tool that utilized the power and accessibility of the Web while promising the same powerful features you&rsquo;d expect from a native app. They surprised everyone with their real-time collaboration feature. Designers were ecstatic to finally be able to share their designs with their co-workers and clients with zero friction, and see multiple mouse pointers drawing shapes simultaneously. It was like magic.</p>
