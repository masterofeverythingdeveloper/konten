<h2>Figma</h2>
<p>Figma is called <strong>the collaborative interface design tool</strong>. And it stands out for its collaboration feature. It gives users the ability to share a design file with multiple team members and get instant feedback from each other via comments. These days most of the other design tools have also implemented the <strong>collaboration</strong> feature but Figma is the one that first brought this to the table.</p>
<p>Figma also provides a lot of useful resources, plugins, and techniques that make your workflow smoother.</p>
