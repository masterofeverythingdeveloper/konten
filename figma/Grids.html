<h2>Grids</h2>
<p>Grids are essential to understanding the negative spacing when you're designing for iOS, Android and Web. For mobile, it&rsquo;s common to use an 8-point grid. For Web, it&rsquo;s a little less about spacing and more about division, like the 960 grid. It's good to have some grid in place, like the default 10-point grid. This ensures that all the elements fall on clean pixels, avoiding half pixels as much as possible.</p>
