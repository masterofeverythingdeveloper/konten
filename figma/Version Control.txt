<h2>Version Control</h2>
<p>In Figma, everything you do is automatically saved in history for free. You can also manually commit (<strong>Command + Option + S</strong>) versions to keep things in a neat timeline. You don&rsquo;t have to think about branches because real-time collaboration allows you to ensure that nobody is stepping on each other&rsquo;s toes. It&rsquo;s actually a relief to not compare this too much to Git because Figma has made the whole process way less complex than Git.</p>
