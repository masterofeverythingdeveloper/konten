<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>Variants work slightly differently from components as they have a different naming system to organize everything. It's very important to keep in mind that only use variants when necessary if not stick to components.</p>
<p>It's best to use variants when dealing with multiple versions of similar components that share the same properties, such as state, size, color, etc. Also, when having two distinct variations like a toggle on/off.</p>
