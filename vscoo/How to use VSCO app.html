<p>Note that if you have more than one photo selected, you won&rsquo;t be able to tap the Edit icon. This is because you can only edit one image at a time. If you have more than one picture selected,&nbsp;deselect all by&nbsp;tapping the <strong>X</strong> at the bottom left of the screen. Then select a single&nbsp;photo to edit.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve opened the editing options, you&rsquo;ll&nbsp;see a row of&nbsp;VSCO filters along the bottom of the screen. VSCO filters are named with letters and numbers, e.g. A6, F1, HB2, S5, Q10:</p>

<p>When editing photos with white subjects and backgrounds, pay attention to slight changes in color tone when you apply a filter.</p>
<p>In the screenshots below, you can see subtle color differences created by the different VSCO filters.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The K1 filter at the bottom left has a pinkish tone. The F2 filter at the bottom right&nbsp;has a blueish tone. The S3 filter at the top right has the most neutral white tones.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even subtle differences in color can have a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;effect on the mood of your photo.</p>
<h2 id="Dark &amp; Moody">Best VSCO Filters: Dark &amp; Moody Atmosphere</h2>
<p>For dark and <a href="https://iphonephotographyschool.com/moody-portrait-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" sl-processed="1">moody photography</a>, use a filter that tones down the colors and darkens the shadows.</p>
<p>Filters with a blue tint can work well as they evoke feelings of coldness, loneliness or sadness.</p>
<p>Try using HB2, J1, M2 or T1 to create a dark, moody photo with a <a href="https://iphonephotographyschool.com/mystery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" sl-processed="1">sense of mystery</a> or <a href="https://iphonephotographyschool.com/drama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" sl-processed="1">drama</a>.</p>

<p>T2 makes the perfect VSCO vintage filter for this photo. With a single tap, you can create a romantic vintage-style look.</p>
<p>Another way to create a vintage-style photo is to make it look like an old polaroid picture. You can do this with the P series of filters which add different color tints to your image.</p>

<p>Try the B series of VSCO filters for a variety of classic black and white edits. Each filter has a different level of brightness and contrast, so you can achieve just the look that you want.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The X series of filters are perfect for creating vintage-style black and white edits. This filter series lets you create beautiful faded black and white photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are also several filters that have a brown or blue color tint. The brown tint is for creating an old-fashioned sepia effect.</p>
<p>Below is the original color photo. The second image&nbsp;was edited with the B2 VSCO filter to create a slightly faded black and white edit. The X4 filter was applied to the third photo to create a vintage-style sepia effect.</p>
