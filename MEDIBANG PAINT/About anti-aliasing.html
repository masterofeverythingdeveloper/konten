<p>Digital images are represented by collections of small points called pixels. Therefore, you can not express finer than pixels.</p>
<p>Here, when drawing a circle filled with black on a small canvas of 20 * 20 pixels, it becomes as follows.</p>

</figure>
<p>In this way, trying to represent a circle with only one color black, the circumference of the circle becomes jagged.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make this pixel &ldquo;gray&rdquo; because this pixel is &ldquo;half covered&rdquo; &hellip; this pixel is &ldquo;covered by 1/4&rdquo; so it is light gray, and so on &hellip; What would be the case when drawing colors with the pixel colors adjusted according to the area?</p>

<p>In this way, you can draw a much cleaner circle than the previous black one color.</p>

<p>This process is called anti-aliasing.</p>
