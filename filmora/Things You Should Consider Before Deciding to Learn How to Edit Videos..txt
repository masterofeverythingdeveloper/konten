<h2 id="things-to-consider-before-editing-videos">Part 1: Things You Should Consider Before Deciding to Learn How to Edit Videos.</h2>
<p>Approaching the post-production process requires you to be prepared and to know exactly what you want to do, with the footage you've captured. Sometimes the camera or a computer, if you were capturing a screencast, can influence your choice of the video editing software, because if the footage you are editing is in the format your video editor won't recognize, you'll have to find another software. Let's have a look at some other aspects of video editing process, you will have to consider before starting to work on your first video.</p>
<h3>1. What type of videos do you want to make?</h3>
<p>Do you want to create a short movie or a movie that lasts more than twenty minutes? Is it a gaming video, a tutorial or an experimental art movie? Knowing exactly what kind of video you want to make will help you narrow down the search for the video editing software, and enable you to know in advance which editing tools you are going to need before you start editing.</p>
<h3>2. System Requirements you are going to need for video editing</h3>
<p>The performance your computer is capable of can severely limit the range of video editing software options you have at your disposal. All professional video editing suites, such as Final Cut and Adobe Premiere have a demanding list of technical requirements your computer has to meet if you want to use them to edit your videos.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>1. </span> Windows PC or Mac?</h4>

<p style="font-size: 10px; text-align: center;">Image from Internet</p>
<p>Desktop configurations for PC computers have gotten more powerful over the years, but Mac computers are still a much better option for video editing because the Mac OS is optimized to enhance the performance of the computer's hardware components. The 2017 Mac Pro, while expensive, is one of the top choices for a video editing computer.</p>
<p>However, these differences matter only to <a href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editor/best-professional-video-editing-software.html" ga360location="content_1_buttonLink_18"> professional video editors </a>who work on demanding projects. Inexperienced video editors can use PC and Mac computers, equally effectively to edit their videos. If the software of your choice has a demanding list of tech specs, you'll just have to make sure that your device meets each and every one of them.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>2. </span> CPU capabilities</h4>
<p>The video rendering process is one of the most demanding tasks on any computer, which can last for hours. A powerful CPU can shorten the video rendering time, and enable your video editing software to run faster. Intel's processors from the i5 and i7 series are widely accepted as the best CPUs for video editing, since they make adding transitions to videos, applying filters and effects or video rendering much smoother. If you would like to edit videos on a constant basis make sure to get the best processor you can.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>3. </span> RAM Memory</h4>
<p>Most video editing software products don't require more than 4 or 8GB of RAM memory to run properly. However, working with large video files can slow down your computer considerably and even make it crash at the decisive moment, so in order to avoid losing hours of work you should get as much RAM memory as you can possibly get. Most Mac and PCs have a 32GB RAM memory limit, but if you are just starting to learn video editing you won't need that much RAM memory.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>4. </span> Hard drive space</h4>
<p>Sometimes a single video file can have more than a couple of gigabytes and the videos you export from the video editing software require a proper storage space. Most experienced video editors use an external hard drive that has several terabytes of storage space for their video editing projects. Furthermore, you will need from 2 to 4 GB of free space on your computer's hard drive to install a video editing software.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>5. </span> The graphics card</h4>
<p>At first, you won't be able to notice how important the graphics card is for the video editing process, because you won't be performing the graphically demanding video editing tasks. Even if you don't have any intention of creating 3D or special effects, you have to pay attention that the computer you're working on has a graphics card capable of high-end performances. Pairing a graphics card with a powerful processor and having more than 16GB of RAM memory will ensure that you are ready for virtually any video editing task.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>6. </span> Monitor:</h4>
<p align="center"><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acer-predator-xb321hk-4k-monitor.jpg" alt="4K monitor" width="650" /></p>
<p>Being able to see the video files on a large screen can help you spot even the tiniest mistakes. Professional video editors frequently use two monitors when they are working on a project, but people who are just learning the ropes of the trade need just one high definition display. The size of the monitor is also important, so using monitors that have more than twenty inches may enable you to make better videos.</p>
<p>Focusing on 4K video editing? Check the list of <a href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/4k/best-4k-monitors-for-video-editing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ga360location="content_1_buttonLink_19"> Best Monitors for 4K Video Footage Editing </a></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Performing the basic video editing actions such as trimming or cutting videos, adding music or applying transitions between the shots doesn't require you to have a computer that has high-end components. As you mature as a video editor you should strive to get better equipment, but until you master the basic video editing techniques you can use any consumer level PC or Mac computer to edit your videos.</p>
<p>Skilled video editors who work on demanding projects need every bit of CPU power or RAM memory they can muster in order to maximize their efficiency and to create the videos that inspire and move the boundaries.</p>
<p>Besides the technical requirements, your video editing skills are the second most important thing you should consider before purchasing a video editing software.</p>
<h3>3. Things to Consider Before Choosing a Video Editor</h3>
<h4 class="heading"><span>1. </span>Your Budget and Editor&rsquo;s Price</h4>
<p>We know some tools are free to download. But, unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t rely on them for high-quality editing. Contrarily, we will never recommend going above your budget, especially when you&rsquo;re the new kid on the block. Therefore, you must decide how much you are ready to pay to get a great video editor.</p>
<p>Inexperienced video editors usually have no need for advanced video editing features, which is why there is no point in investing hundreds of dollars into a software that provides the video editing tools you will never use. You can find some of the best entry-level, as well as professional video editing software products, for Mac and PC computers featured in the table below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/best-video-editing-software-comparison.jpg" alt="video editing  
software comparison" width="960" /></p>
<p>All the above tools in the table are cost-friendly. Or, in other words, you don&rsquo;t have to pay a fortune to get them. Nevertheless, the professional category could be expensive, but guess what? There are some great alternatives, such as Filmora.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>2. </span>User-Friendly Interface</h4>
<p>When selecting a video editor, make sure you know if it has an easy interface or is extremely difficult with lots of hidden features. Trust us; if you&rsquo;re new, you&rsquo;ll regret buying a tool with greater difficulty.</p>
<p>Therefore, find software with simple video editing options. It would be better to get the one with loads of presets, effects, and features. Moreover, try to look for an editor with a clean timeline that allows adding multiple tracks.</p>
<p>Likewise, you should look for a drag-and-drop option to import videos to the software&rsquo;s library and apply effects to your video. This drag-and- drop feature will save your time and allow you to learn the tool as quickly as possible.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>3. </span>Learning Resources</h4>
<p>Another important factor is the availability of learning material. If the software you choose has fewer learning blogs and videos, you will get badly stuck later and won&rsquo;t find a way out. On the other hand, a video editor with lots of information and tutorials over the internet is a boon. All the stuff will not just help you overcome a challenge in your video editing journey, but you will also be able to polish your skills.</p>
<p>You can be your own judge and try looking for learning resources for your preferred software. If you think there&rsquo;s enough material to learn from, you can list the tool in your favorites.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t be so quick because there are a few more factors left that you should know.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>4. </span>Supported Video Formats</h4>
<p>This is a really important factor. So before opting for a video editor, ensure it supports all video formats. And if not all, then at least the widely used ones.</p>
<p>We have seen editors that only allow you to import and export videos in two or three formats. In the same way, some tools are good for nothing as they allow editing in old formats, which people don&rsquo;t even use in 2022.</p>
<p>Look for a video editor that supports MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, F4V, TS, 3GP, F4V, MPEG-2, GIF, MP3, and WEBM. A video editor supporting all these input and output formats will make video editing easier and more satisfying.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>5. </span>Advanced Features</h4>
<p>Fall for a video editor that equips the latest features. It will scale your editing to the next level and help you make attractive and catchy videos.</p>
<p>For instance, the editor you are considering should have the Chrome key effect. It should contain a built-in screen recorder if you&rsquo;re making a tutorial video for your YouTube subscribers. It should have 3D effects, great color grading tools, and more.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>6. </span>Media Library</h4>
<p>There&rsquo;s no time to look for music and videos from third-party sites. Therefore, make sure the software you choose has a built-in media library with lots of royalty-free videos and music so you can use it on your project.</p>
<h4 class="heading"><span>7. </span>Customer Support</h4>
<p>Last but not the least, if you&rsquo;re buying a video editor, you should check the customer support reviews before going ahead. Why? Because sometimes, you do need assistance from the company to upgrade your account information or simply retrieve a lost password. If customer support is unresponsive, it&rsquo;s better to look for another tool.</p>
