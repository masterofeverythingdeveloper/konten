<p>You know, it&rsquo;s called&nbsp;<em>nonlinear&nbsp;</em>editing for a reason. You&rsquo;re moving and shifting clips around as you wish on a&nbsp;<em>timeline</em>, creating an entirely new sequence of events. Premiere Pro has a handful of tools that allow you to dive down into your footage and manipulate time on a clip level.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take a look at a few.</p>
<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">&nbsp;</div>

<h3 id="h-1-the-rate-stretch-tool">1. The Rate Stretch Tool</h3>
<p>One of the fastest ways to manipulate time in Premiere Pro is via the&nbsp;Rate Stretch&nbsp;tool. Simply press the&nbsp;R&nbsp;key to bring it up. Hover over the edge of a clip to watch the tooltip activate. Click-and-drag to speed up or slow down your video. The speed is displayed via a percentile in the clip name. If you can&rsquo;t see it, click on the&nbsp;Wrench&nbsp;icon and activate&nbsp;Show Video Names.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-2-speed-duration-controls">2. Speed/Duration Controls</h3>
<p>For more precise control over the timing of your clip, grab the layer and go to&nbsp;Clip &gt; Speed/Duration. As the name implies, the Clip Speed/Duration dialogue box allows you to manually type in a specific speed or duration. Once again, speed is represented in percentile. To keep the clip&nbsp;In&nbsp;and&nbsp;Out&nbsp;points set in the same place on the timeline, simply unlink the&nbsp;Speed&nbsp;and&nbsp;Duration&nbsp;controls before making changes to the speed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Clip Speed/Duration can also reverse the speed of a clip, maintain the audio pitch, and activate ripple delete options. When changing speed, choose between three different interpolation methods:&nbsp;Frame Sampling,&nbsp;Frame Blending, or&nbsp;Optical Flow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-3-posterize-time">3. Posterize Time</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;Posterize Time&nbsp;effect allows users to manually set a frame rate. I use this effect often to stylize my videos. For example, you can get a hand-animated or stop-motion style look by bringing the&nbsp;FPS&nbsp;down to&nbsp;12-18. Or, you can get a more cinematic look by bringing&nbsp;60fps&nbsp;footage down to&nbsp;24fps.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-4-interpret-footage">4. Interpret Footage</h3>
<p>To change the frame rate of a clip at the project level, use the&nbsp;Interpret Footage&nbsp;dialogue box. To open this, grab your clip in the&nbsp;Project&nbsp;panel and go to&nbsp;Clip &gt; Modify &gt; Interpret Footage.&nbsp;This will show you the native frame rate of the file, but also let you assume a custom frame rate.</p>
<a href="https://pbblogassets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/14131447/Interpret-Footage-1.jpg" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external"><img class="wp-image-156836" src="https://pbblogassets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/14131447/Interpret-Footage-1.jpg" alt="Interpret Footage " width="755" height="425" /></a><em>An example of Interpret Footage.</em>
<p>The difference between&nbsp;Interpret Footage&nbsp;and&nbsp;Posterize Time&nbsp;is that Posterize Time won&rsquo;t change the duration, and it&rsquo;s applied on a clip level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature is especially useful when importing image sequences from other programs. Premiere Pro might be importing a clip at the wrong frame rate by default, so you can have it assume the frame rate you want.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-5-time-remapping">5. Time Remapping</h3>
<a href="https://pbblogassets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/19072447/time-remapping-new.jpg" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external"><img class="wp-image-156906" src="https://pbblogassets.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/07/19072447/time-remapping-new.jpg" alt="" width="755" height="425" /></a><em>Manually add and remove speed keyframes directly on the clip in the timeline.</em>
<p>If you want to get serious about playing with time in Adobe Premiere Pro, then you&rsquo;ll want to learn how to remap it. Time Remapping takes some practice to master. The easiest way to work is directly in the timeline panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To begin,&nbsp;right-click&nbsp;on a clip and select&nbsp;Show Clip Keyframes &gt; Time Remapping &gt; Speed. You can manually add and remove speed keyframes directly on the clip in the timeline via a&nbsp;Ctrl + Left Click&nbsp;on the horizontal line. Drag the line up to increase the speed of a section. Drag it down to decrease the speed. To ease the ramping between speed changes and smooth out the transition, drag and spread out the handles of each keyframe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can feel a bit clunky at first, but after a few animations, you&rsquo;ll get used to the experience.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-a-note-on-time-interpolation">A Note on Time Interpolation</h3>
<p>Depending on your source footage, you might have to play around with the various interpolation methods to see what looks best. In an ideal situation, you would&rsquo;ve captured the footage correctly. For example, shooting at a higher frame rate gives you smooth slow motion because you have more frames to work with. The computer isn&rsquo;t creating or blending frames together.&nbsp;</p>
